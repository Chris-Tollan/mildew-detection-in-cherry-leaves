# Mildew Detection in Cherry Leaves

This project was developed for Farmy & Foods, a company in the agricultural sector that produces and harvests different types of food. Recently, the company has faced a challenge where their cherry plantations have been presenting powdery mildew, which is a fungal disease that affects a wide range of plants. The cherry plantation crop is one of their finest products and the company is concerned about supplying the market with a product of compromised quality.

Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that commonly affects cherry trees. It appears as a white or gray powdery substance on the leaves, stems, and sometimes fruit of the tree. The fungus responsible for powdery mildew thrives in warm, humid conditions and is spread through spores being carried by the wind.

The risk of infection with powdery mildew is relatively high in cherry trees, especially during periods of warm, humid weather. Once infected, the fungus can spread rapidly throughout the tree and cause damage to the leaves, reducing the tree's ability to photosynthesize and eventually impacting fruit production.

To prevent and manage powdery mildew in cherry trees, it is important to regularly inspect the tree for signs of infection and take prompt action to control the spread of the fungus. This may involve using fungicides, pruning affected branches, and practicing good plant hygiene to reduce the risk of infection.

Prior to completion of this project, Farmy & Foods employees would manually inspect leaves to establish if they were infected or healthy. This process would usually take around 30 minutes per tree. 

The main overall intention of the project was to create a Machine Learning System with the capability to instantly detect in an image of a leave was healthy or infected, this would ensure the company could continue to provide a high quality healthy product without the need for time consuming manual inspections.

## Dataset Content

The dataset for this project was provided by the client. It contained a total of 4208 images which were split into 2104 healthy images and 2104 powery mildew infected images of cherry leaves.

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves)

## Deployment
The project code is stored on GitHub and deployed with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). 
The steps needed to deploy this projects are as follows:

### Heroku

* The App live link is: https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/ 
* Set the runtime.txt Python version to a [Heroku-20](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version.
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. At the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click now the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large then add large files not required for the app to the .slugignore file. 

## Cloning this repository

In order to work on this repository you will first need to clone it.

**Instructions to clone the repository**:

1 - While in the GitHub repository, click on the green code button.

2 - Copy the link.

3 - In your IDE or local coding environment use the link to open the repository. 

For example: in CodeAnywhere
- Click on 'Add new workspace'
- You will then be given the option to 'Create from your project repository' and a box in which to paste the link
- CodeAnywhere will now open a new workspace containing the repository.
- You should now be set up ready to work on the repository.

## Forking a branch

In order to protect the main branch while you work on something new, essential when working as part of a team or when you want to experiment with a new feature, you will need to fork a branch.

**Instructions to fork the repository**:

1 - While in the GitHub repository, click on the branch symbol and text indicating the number of branches.

2 - This will load details on current branches. Click on the green 'New branch' button.

3 - Enter a name for the new branch and then click the green 'create new branch' button.

4 - Your new branch should now have appeared on the screen.

5 - Clicking on the new branch and then following the steps for cloning will allow you to open up and work on this branch.
